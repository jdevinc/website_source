		CodicePlastico is a small but mighty team<br>
		of software engineers
	</h1>
	<p>
		In our team we only have space for those who have a wild passion for technology and perfection. We are a group of 7 developers who like working in a team, but we also give our best working individually listening to our favorite music.
	</p>
	<p>
		We strongly believe in keeping each other informed and our typical day always starts with a standup meeting. Training is another fundamental element of our life as developers: we spend a lot of time learning, getting to know and trying out new technologies which helps us improve the way we write software.

				Software craftsman, husband, father, ex-sportsman and inquiring reader. Since I was young I have loved taking apart and reassembling things to understand how they work. Now, this passion has become my job: the step from Lego to software development was a short one. Finding the best possible solution so that a complex system can work at its best and making it run smoothly are the goals of my work. C#, WCF, ESB, MongoDb and Azure make up my survival toolkit and help me cruise through distributed systems and enterprise solutions with ease. Be it a command or an event, I try to do my best in contributing to the life of the communities that have adopted me (ugidotnet and WEBdeBS), trying to "give back" at least a part of what I have received over these years.

				I am an architect and software developer with more than 10 years’ experience in building web applications. I have always been curious and interested in learning new technologies and new languages, and over the last few years I have spent my time in frontend development, taking in my stride the quirks of javascript and different browser personalities. C#, Ruby, Javascript, Test Driven Development, Patterns and Clean Code are the languages I speak every day. I love to share what I learn, actively participating in conferences as a speaker at numerous events for various developer communities. But I don’t just live for technology: in my spare time I really enjoy freshwater sailing on Lake Garda and being a “perfect dad”.

				Geeky mum, music lover and clarinetist for more than ten years, I successfully share my time between my work and my two children. I started off writing C# code, and today I switch between WPF projects, Asp.NET MVC, Silverlight, to name but a few. After a brief Python development experience, I am now enthusiastic about developing mobile applications for Android. Whilst during the day I work with the team to deliver bespoke projects for clients, once home I "replace" the computer with the sewing machine, to dedicate myself to my sewing hobby!

				"There’s always a better code" is the philosophy I try to put into practice every day and which continuously drives me to find the best solution for each project.  I’m always on the trail of new technologies which will add that touch of magic to applications and which make every developer’s life much easier.  In my spare time I tend to my guitar collection, run after a ball (a hobby of mine from time immemorial) and try to avoid breaking my neck when I’m on any kind of board, with or without wheels.

				Developing software has been my passion since childhood, and I still remember with a tinge of nostalgia the days when I used to code old-school video games! Through the years my passion has become my professional career, and the same passion drives me every day when I craft quality software with the rest of the team. "Lifelong learning" is my motto, both professionally and personally: be it a programming language, a sport or a recipe, if it's new, I've got to try it! When I am not sitting in front of a computer monitor, I like to unwind by hiking in the nearby mountains, snapping pictures and attempting to play the piano.

				When I was a little girl, if someone asked me what I would want to be as a grown-up I used to answer "an engineer". The passion for new technologies naturally led me to Computer Science. With a lot of sacrifice and perseverance my  dream came true: I have been working as a software developer for more than 3 years. I'm sure that the best is yet to come and so I face the daily challenges of my work willing to improve my skills and learn new things, also relying on the fruitful cooperation with the team. When I turn off the computer, I enjoy my great passions: AS Roma football team and Francesco Totti, shopping (I'm a bit of a fashion addict) and travelling.

				I'm an experienced software engineer: I'm working since 2003 and I grew up professionally in the Java and JEE ecosystem. However, I always tried to keep alive my curiosity and my desire to learn something new every day: I therefore welcomed with enthusiasm the opportunity to bring to play my architectural and methodological skills in a different technological environment, firmly belief that the real common language is to desire to make things in the most clean and elegant way and to continuously share informations, skills and experiences.
I collaborate since over ten years as a teaching assistant with the University of Brescia, discovering and rediscovering that teaching is the best way to learn.
I'm a passionate cyclist and a serial reader - from Divina Commedia to technical readings, from novels to the phone book - but the great passion of my life are "my women": my wife and our wonderful daughters.

				My background is based on classical studies. Having put aside the Greek dictionary and the pedagogical textbooks,
				my choices and a bit of chance have led me to become familiar with the world of secretariat and administration.
				My motto is "order", I like to find the right place for everything and I am passionate about organization and arrangement,
				as much on the desk as within the walls of the house.
				In my free time I love reading and I enjoy cooking cakes for my two girls and my husband.
